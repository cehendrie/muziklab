muziklib
========

A simple python module for sorting and combining lists of music.

TODO
* add a test flag for validating music entries
* each entry must have a band name, album name, year, and format
* validate year seems reasonable e.g. not before say 1930 or after current year
* format should be validated against a known list of formats
* validation for one file at a time
* possibly add a config to define the entry's format
* better logging (i.e. there is none)
